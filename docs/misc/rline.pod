== Example repository ==
Legend
* cX ... commit number X (main rline v1)
* cXb ... commit number X, rline with marked as b
* vX ... rline marked as X

Commits ordered by 'committer date' are c1, c2, c3, c4, c5x, c6x, c7, c8, c9, c10y, c11z, c12y.


    |c1 (-)  -> v1 ... no parent
    |c2 (c1) -> v1 ... one parent without descendant -> inherit v1 from c1
    |c3 (c2) -> v1 ... one parent without descendant -> inherit v1 from c2
    |\
    | \
    |  \
  c4|   |   ... c4 (c3) -> v1 ... one parent without descendant -> inherit v1 from c3
    |   |c5x (c3)  -> v2 ... one parent already with one (c4) descendant -> new rline v2
    |   |c6x (c6x) -> v2 ... one parent without descendant -> inherit v2 from c5x
    |  / \

    |c7 (c4,c6x) -> v1  ... more than one parent - c3c merged to c3 -> inherit v1 from c3
    |c8 -> v1 ... one parent without descendant, inherit v1 from c7
    |\
    | \
    |  | c9 (c8) -> v1 ... one parent without descendant, inherit v1 from c8

c12y|  |     ... c12y (c10y) -> v3 ... one parent without descendant, inherit v3 from c10y
   v3  v1

State:
* v1, v3 (master), v4 - not merged yet
* v2 - already merged to v1


== Metacode ==
To fill rline table and rcommit.rline_id
* no parent -> add rline (see below)
* one parent without descendant -> inherit rline
* one parent already with any descendant -> add rline (see below)
* more than one parent - first parent is cX -> inherit rline from cX

Add new rline (found not merge commit give type, see above)
* find max rline_num for rep_id (rline_id -> rcommit_id -> rep_id)
* insert to rline (to_rcommit_id is same as from_rcommit_id)
* insert self link to rline_hier

Finishing
* Update rline.to_rcommit_id values from cache.


== Table rref_rcommit ==
* rref_id
* rcommit_id

rref data change
* same rline_id - add new rcommits
* changed rline_id
** load rcommits history - make changes


== Tables content for example ==
Table rline
rline_id  first_rcommit_id  last_rcommit_id
1 (v1),   c1,               c12y
2 (v2),   c5x (v1),         c6x
3 (v3),   c10y (v1),        c12y
4 (v4),   c11z (v2),        c11z


== Used to ==
These rline table is used to get some ancestors for given rcommit_id (rcommit_idA):
* for rcommit_idA get rcommit rline_idA ( rcommit.rline_id )
* get all rcommits where rcommit.rline_id = rline_idA and commmitter_time <= commmitter_time of rcommit_idA
* so e.g.
** for c9 (v1) you get c1, c2, c3, c4, c7, c8, c9
** for c4 (v1) you get c1, c2, c3, c4
** for c6x (v2) you get c5x, c6x
** for c10y (v3) you get c10y, c12y
** for c11z (v4) you get c11z

To get full history for c6x (c6x, c5x, c3, c2, c1):
* use prev instructions, so for c6x you get c6x, c5x
* get parent fo c5x (first commit for rline_idA) -> c3
* get parent rline_idB for this commit c3 -> v1
* add full history of c3 (repeat steps for c3)
* ....
